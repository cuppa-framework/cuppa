**Cuppa 1.6.0 is now available.**

This release adds a new method to the `Runner`, `#getExitCode` that can be called after a test run
to determine the overall status of the test run.

The following list specifies the order in which the exit code is determined:
* If no tests are run the exit code will be `4`
* If any block, test hook or test fails the exit code will be `1`
* If any test is skipped the exit code will be `2`
* If any test is pending the exit code will be `3`
* If none of the above the exit code will be `0`
