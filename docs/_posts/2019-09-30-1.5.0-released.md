**Cuppa 1.5.0 is now available.**

This release exposes the run parameters for which groups/tags to run to the `ConfigurationProvider` via `Configuration#getRunOptions()` and `Runner.TagRunOption` option type. To enable working with the now-visible groups expressions, the `expression` package and classes are now public and supported.

With this extra information, it is possible to apply tags in different ways to the out-of-the-box behaviour, and so an additional method is added to remove the default test transforms, `Configuration#removeCoreTestTransforms()`.

Finally, the two existing `Runner` constructors have been deprecated, and constructors that use the new `Options` to provide tag configuration are added.
